===========

Building

After the sync is finished, please read the instructions from the Android site on how to build.

. build/envsetup.sh && brunch marvel

- You can also build (and see how long it took) for specific devices like this:


. build/envsetup.sh
time brunch aokp_marvel-userdebug


Remember to make clobber every now and then!
